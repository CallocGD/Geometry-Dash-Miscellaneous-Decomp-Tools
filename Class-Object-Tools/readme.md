# Class Object Tools and more
these are new tools I've recently used and I have since updated our inital methods for copying and pasing data-structures in ghidra on android
so this game is easier to reverse along with less shitty code generated from ghidra.

# Mentionable files included
- `data.h` is a merged header file of the cocos2d class information from the [cocosheaders repo]() that the header parser python library I'm using can at least read and understand the data being used  
- A Tool to turn data.h into a json file and sql database using sqlmodel and orjson
