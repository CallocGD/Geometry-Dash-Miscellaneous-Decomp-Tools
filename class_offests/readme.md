# Class Offset Information And Possibly Tools
This will be an extra place where I dump my reverse engineered objects from Ghidra into here since As Far as I am aware, the Geode Bindings do not have a script yet to fill 
in class members which is annoying to work with. I will likely write a script in java to get around this issue and the slowness of typing in class_members manually in the future 
but for now I will dump csv styled files into either cocos2d or gd folders because sometimes Robtop's subclasses of cocos Objects use those class members hence this being a very 
useful secondary resource... 

- The csv files will be in the gd or cocos2d folders If they aren't readable enough or don't have good into I will rewrite them all as json files...

## TODOS
- Maybe a Ghidra Script written in Java (Since Python version isn't totally working for Python 3 yet) to help auto fill in subclasses members (simillar to IDA-PRO, I think...),
from completely finished classes objects Inherited from CCObjects and other Class variables From Geometry Dash and more because writing these members by hand is a pain in the ass...
