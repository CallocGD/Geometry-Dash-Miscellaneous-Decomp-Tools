# Scripts
These numerous scripts are meant to help me with Fixing Geode bindings, repairing class members and generating code that is repetative or boring to write by hand
and have the potential to cut time down to reverse engineer Robtop's C++ code for Geometry Dash significantly.


## How to Install

The Majority if not all of these are python scripts meant to be small, tiny and require minimal use of external libraries.
All written in python 3.9.18 however earlier version of python should work as far as I am aware...

HINT: please remeber to cd to `scripts` before installing this stuff or else the the command shown might fail...
```
pip -r requirements.txt
```

## Plans
C++ Versions of some of these scripts are planned if you absolutely refuse to install python
